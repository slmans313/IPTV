# IPTV

Hi all, this is just a public list I compile in my hobby time. Feel free to fork or take whatever you want. I hope you all will be inspired to make more tidy playlists of your own.<br /> 

## Usage

All the M3U-playlist is very very experimental at the moment. The GoCast playlists is a public list of every link I have collect so far. No gurantee the link over there will work. Drop me a email if any of the links is not working. I don't expect any people to share their links although you are welcome too.<br />

At the moment I maintain 2 playlists at the GoCast2 section for an Malaysian/Singaporean audience:<br />

- https://exodiver.github.io/IPTV/GoCast2/Oriental/Gugong.m3u8 (Orient focused playlist - Chinese, Korean, Japanese)<br />
- https://exodiver.github.io/IPTV/GoCast2/Oriental/Istana.m3u8 (Malay/Indian  focused playlist - Malaysia, Indonesia, Major Thai/Arab/Turkish,Hindi/Bengali/Urdu/Malayalam/Punjabi,Tamil TV Channel)<br />

And an very very very very very very experiemental EPG:<br />

## Complaints FAQ

1. If link is down, do drop me a message. I have a day job too, so don't expect any quick support unless you want donate money or servers to me. <br />

2. I don't sell or trade IPTV list. If I don't share a link, it is because it does not work for me.<br />

3. Be considerate and civilised<br />

4. PLEASE don't rely it as your daily iptv day or use this list for your business. I change the contents of playlist all the time. So your channel goes missing, chances are that they link can't work for me and you.<br />

5. Some of the link (especially the Geo-Restricted link) can be play with tivimate/tvirl without the need for a VPN/Smart DNS. So if it can't be play with other iptv program, do consider using tivimate/tvirl. <br />

6. For sports channel lover, please support your cable tv provider. Their streams are the best, no doubt. I have never find a stable, fast unofficial sports streaming link in my entire life, chances are you will feel the same <br />

7. None of the links is my work. I just choose to share my private tv collection of links. <br />
